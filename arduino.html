        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p class="para">Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. Arduino consists of a
            piece of software,
            or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer and a physical programmable circuit
            board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and , used to write and upload computer
            code to the physical board.
            The Arduino platform is easy to use and multi purpose board for people just starting out with electronics.
            Unlike most previous programmable circuit boards, the Arduino does not need a separate piece of
            hardware (called a programmer) in order to load new code onto the board. It comes with a USB cable and can
            be directly pogrammed using IDE.
            Arduino program is written using C++ making it easier to learn to program. Arduino has a huge suport of
            packages and libraries covering a lot of support hardware and software tools.

        <h1>Understand the arduino board</h1>
        <img class="hero-img" src="ard_2.png">
        <p class="para">
            <h3>USB/Barrel Jack</h3>
            <p>
                Every Arduino board needs a way to be connected to a power source. The Arduino UNO can be powered from a
                USB cable coming from your computer or a wall power supply (like this) that is terminated in a barrel
                jack. In the picture above the USB connection is labeled (1) and the barrel jack is labeled (2).
                The USB connection is also how you will load code onto your Arduino board.
            </p>
            <h3>Pins (5V, 3.3V, GND, Analog, Digital, PWM, AREF)</h3>
            <p>
                The pins on your Arduino are the places where you connect wires to construct a circuit (probably in
                conjuction with a breadboard and some wire. They usually have black plastic ‘headers’ that allow you to
                just plug a wire right into the board. The Arduino has several different kinds of pins, each of which is
                labeled on the board and used for different functions.
                <ul>
                    <li>GND (3): Short for ‘Ground’. There are several GND pins on the Arduino, any of which can be used
                        to ground your circuit.</li>
                    <li>5V (4) & 3.3V (5): As you might guess, the 5V pin supplies 5 volts of power, and the 3.3V pin
                        supplies 3.3 volts of power.
                    </li>
                    <li>Analog
                        (6): The area of pins under the ‘Analog In’ label (A0 through A5 on the UNO) are Analog In pins.
                        These pins can read the signal from an analog sensor (like a temperature sensor) and convert it
                        into a digital value that we can read.
                    </li>
                    <li>Digital
                        (7): Across from the analog pins are the digital pins (0 through 13 on the UNO). These pins can
                        be used for both digital input (like telling if a button is pushed) and digital output (like
                        powering an LED).
                    </li>
                    <li>PWM
                        (8): You may have noticed the tilde (~) next to some of the digital pins (3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11
                        on the UNO). These pins act as normal digital pins, but can also be used for something called
                        Pulse-Width Mo dulation (PWM).
                    </li>
                    <li>AREF
                        (9): Stands for Analog Reference. Most of the time you can leave this pin alone. It is sometimes
                        used to set an external reference voltage (between 0 and 5 Volts) as the upper limit for the
                        analog input pins.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Reset Button</h3>
            Every Arduino board has a reset button (10). Pushing it will temporarily connect the reset pin to ground and
            restart any code that is loaded on the Arduino. This can be very useful if your
            code doesn’t repeat, but you want to test it multiple times.
            <h3>Power LED Indicator</h3>
            <p>
                Just beneath and to the right of the word “UNO” on your circuit board, there’s a tiny LED next to the
                word ‘ON’ (11). This LED should light up whenever you plug your Arduino into a power source. If this
                light doesn’t turn on, there’s a good chance something is wrong.
            </p>
            <h3>TX RX LEDs</h3>
            <p>TX is short for transmit, RX is short for receive. These markings appear quite a bit in electronics to
                indicate the pins responsible for serial communication. In this case, there are two places on the
                Arduino
                UNO where TX and RX appear -- once by digital pins 0 and 1, and a second time next to the TX and RX
                indicator LEDs (12). These LEDs will give us some nice visual indications whenever our Arduino is
                receiving or transmitting data.
            </p>
            <h3>Main IC (13)</h3>
            <p>
                An IC, or Integrated Circuit is the brain of amicrocontroller board. The main IC on the Arduino is
                slightly different from board type to board type, but is
                usually from the ATmega line of IC’s from the ATMEL company. This can be important, as you may need to
                know the IC type (along with your board type) before loading up a new program from the Arduino software.

        <h1>The Arduino Family</h1>

        <h3>Arduino UNO</h3>
        <img class="hero-img" src="ard_1.png">
        <p>The Uno is a great choice for your first Arduino. It's got everything you need to get started, and nothing
            you don't. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a
            USB connection, a power jack, a reset button and more. It contains everything needed to support the
            microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or
            battery to get started.</p>

        <h3>Arduino LilyPad</h3>
        <img class="hero-img" src="ard_4.png">
        <p>This is LilyPad Arduino main board! LilyPad is a wearable e-textile technology developed by Leah Buechley and
            cooperatively designed by Leah and SparkFun. Each LilyPad was creatively designed with large connecting pads
            and a flat back to allow them to be sewn into clothing with conductive thread. The LilyPad also has its own
            family of input, output, power, and sensor boards that are also built specifically for e-textiles. They're
            even washable!</p>

        <h3>Arduino MEGA</h3>
        <img class="hero-img" src="ard_5.png">
        <p>The Arduino Mega is like the UNO's big brother. It has lots (54!) of digital input/output pins (14 can be
            used as PWM outputs), 16 analog inputs, a USB connection, a power jack, and a reset button. It contains
            everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power
            it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. The large number of pins make this board very handy
            for projects that require a bunch of digital inputs or outputs (like lots of LEDs or buttons).</p>

        <h3>Arduino LEONARDO</h3>
        <img class="hero-img" src="ard_6.png">
        <p>The Leonardo is Arduino's first development board to use one microcontroller with built-in USB. This means
            that it can be cheaper and simpler. Also, because the board is handling USB directly, code libraries are
            available which allow the board to emulate a computer keyboard, mouse, and more!</p>

        <h1>Arduino IDE</h1>
        <img class="hero-img" src="ard_7.png" style="margin-right: 50rem;">
        <p>
            The Arduino integrated development environment (IDE) is a cross-platform application that is written in the
            programming language Java. It originated from the IDE for the languages Processing and Wiring. It includes a
            code editor with features such as text cutting and pasting, searching and replacing text, automatic
            indenting, brace matching, and syntax highlighting, and provides simple one-click mechanisms to compile and
            upload programs to an Arduino board. It also contains a message area, a text console, a toolbar with buttons
            for common functions and a hierarchy of operation menus. The Arduino IDE supports the languages C and C++
            using special rules of code structuring. The Arduino IDE supplies a software library from the Wiring
            project, which provides many common input and output procedures. User-written code only requires two basic
            functions, for starting the sketch and the main program loop, that are compiled and linked with a program
            stub main() into an executable cyclic executive program with the GNU toolchain, also included with the IDE
            distribution. The Arduino IDE employs the program avrdude to convert the executable code into a text file in
            hexadecimal encoding that is loaded into the Arduino board by a loader program in the board's firmware.
